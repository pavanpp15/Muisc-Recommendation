# Muisc-Recommendation
The goal of the project is to design and implement Music Recommendation system that works on user data and ratings and provides recommendations for songs. It then processes the input data using various algorithms. Then the algorithm predicts the recommendations for songs i.e track.Training data includes usersâ€™ ratings history for tracks, albums, artists and genres. A song track is in an album. An album is with an artist. An artist is with one or more genres. Users can rate any item with a score between 0~100. The task is to find three tracks a user may like among six given tracks. This project uses Yahoo Music Dataset which is very sparse.
